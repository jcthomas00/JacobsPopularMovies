UDACITY PROJECT 1 - POPULAR MOVIES
CREATED BY JACOB THOMAS

What does it do?
1) App displays popular movies from www.TheMovieDatabase.org
2) The home screen shows a grid of movie posters
3) The grid is sortable by popularity or ratings
4) Clicking on a thumbnail of any poster brings up a second
		page with details about the movie.
		
How was it made?
1) It was created in Android Studio 1.5.1 in a Windows environment
2) The Android Volley Library was used to communicate and obtain 
	data from www.TheMovieDatabase.org as it was easier to implement
	than asyncTask
3) A lot of the code for Volley implementation was taken from the 
	tutorials at: http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html
